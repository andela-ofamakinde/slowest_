# This is one of the worst performing Rails apps ever.

Currently, the home page takes this long to load:

```bash
...
Article Load (0.5ms)  SELECT "articles".* FROM "articles" WHERE "articles"."author_id" = ?  [["author_id", 3000]]
Article Load (0.5ms)  SELECT "articles".* FROM "articles" WHERE "articles"."author_id" = ?  [["author_id", 3001]]
Rendered author/index.html.erb within layouts/application (9615.5ms)
Completed 200 OK in 9793ms (Views: 7236.5ms | ActiveRecord: 2550.1ms)
```

The view takes 7.2 seconds to load. The AR querying takes 2.5 second to load. The page takes close to 10 seconds to load. That's not great at all. That's just awful.

The stats page is even worse:

```bash
Rendered stats/index.html.erb within layouts/application (9.9ms)
Completed 200 OK in 16197ms (Views: 38.0ms | ActiveRecord: 4389.4ms)
```

It took 16 seconds to load and a lot of the time taken isn't even in the ActiveRecord querying or the view. It's the creation of ruby objects that is taking a lot of time. This will be explained in further detail below.

So, **What can we do?**

Well, let's focus on improving the view and the AR querying first!

# What to do with this app
* add an index to the correct columns
* implement eager loading vs lazy loading on the right pages.
* replace Ruby lookups with ActiveRecord methods.
* page cache or fragment cache the root page.
* The root page needs to implement includes, pagination, and fragment caching.

##### Ruby vs ActiveRecord

Let's try to get some ids from our Article model.

Look at Ruby:

```ruby
puts Benchmark.measure {Article.select(:id).collect{|a| a.id}}
  Article Load (2.6ms)  SELECT "articles"."id" FROM "articles"
  0.020000   0.000000   0.020000 (  0.021821)
```

The real time is 0.021821 for the Ruby query.

vs ActiveRecord

```ruby
puts Benchmark.measure {Article.pluck(:id)}
   (3.2ms)  SELECT "articles"."id" FROM "articles"
  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.006992)
```
The real time is 0.006992 for the AR query. Ruby is about 300% slower.

For example, this code is terribly written in the Author model:

```ruby
def self.most_prolific_writer
  all.sort_by{|a| a.articles.count }.last
end

def self.with_most_upvoted_article
  all.sort_by do |auth|
    auth.articles.sort_by do |art|
      art.upvotes
    end.last
  end.last
end
```

Both methods use Ruby methods (sort_by) instead of ActiveRecord. Let's fix that.

##### Caching

Our main view currently takes 4 seconds to load

```bash
Rendered author/index.html.erb within layouts/application (5251.7ms)
Completed 200 OK in 5269ms (Views: 4313.1ms | ActiveRecord: 955.6ms)
```

Let's fix that.
